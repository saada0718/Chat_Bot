This is a chat bot made in python. This bot takes in input from the user. If the person would like to search something on the internet then the person should simply enter "search"
followed by a space and then what they would like to enter. If a person would like to go to a specific website then the person should the person should simply enter "go to"
followed by a space and then where they would like to go. Doing this will search the website on google and visit the first link. It then asks the user if the website was the one
they were looking for. If it was then the program simply continues. However, if it was not the website that they were looking for then it asks the user for the url and then stores
the url and visits that url the next time. The chat bot also communicates with the user. If the user enters something that the bot does not know then the bot asks for the responses
to that specific text and stores and replys with the first one that it recieved. However, if it does encounter something that it has seen before then it responds with the item that
the user has used the most.
